# NLP_SentimentAnalysis_ProductReview
Thie aim of this project is to analyse data from amazon review page in facebook/other social media and perform sentiment analysis based on which we can provide insights about public opinion on a certain product. The notebook e-commerce_sentiment_analysis_.ipynb contains the necessary codes. The main steps associated with code are : 1. Import the necessary modules . 2. Load the data set containing details about the product, the review statements by customers and its corresponding ratings by the individual user. The ratings 1-3 are treated as low ratings and 4-5 are high ratings. 3. The next step is the pre-processing step where we vectorize each word . Thus each word of the review is treated as a vector. This is essentialy a one-hot encoding or embedding. 4. The next step involves constructing the LSTM model. 5. This is followed by splitting the dataset into training and testing cases. 6. The final step involves training the model ultimately validating the model by applying in the test cases.
